## This Project Was Completed by Writing The Following:

- My Own main.c file.
- States files for every stage (pressure sensor, main algorithm, alarm monitor and LED driver).
- startup.c and linker_script.ld
- makefile for automation.
- simulation using proteus.

## The Tools Which is used in developing this project:
1. TTool ( for System Architecture).
2. Visual Studio Code.
3. ARM Cross Toolchain.
4. Proteus.
5. Terminal.
6. Git & Github.


## Note:
#### To run this project you install the source code and the tools I have mentioned and open the directory of the project in terminal and just hit make.


**There is also map_file with all the project symbols and sections of memory which can be found in the bin folder.**
