# Lab on interfacing between 2 Atmega32 microcontrollers using SPI protocol.

- In this lab the master MCU will send data to the slave, The slave will also send data to the master but the data will be distinct from the master's.
- The data being sent is going to be displayed on a 7 segment display to show that each data is distinct.
