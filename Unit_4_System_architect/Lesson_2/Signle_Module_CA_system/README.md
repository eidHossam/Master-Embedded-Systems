## This assignment is practice on:
- How to design your system before starting,
- How to describe your application through block diagrams.
- How to describe the process of your application through a flow-diagram.
- Test this process through the flow-diagram before even starting to write any code to verify your logic.
- Finally how to implement the desing you made in well structered C code.
